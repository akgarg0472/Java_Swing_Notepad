# java_swing_notepad
This is a mini project in which java swing is used to design notepad application which is fully functioning.
Anyone who has basic knowledge of Java programming language, text editor application (Notepad) and java swing etc then this mini project is not a difficult task for him/her.

I have used only basic UI Elements of java AWT and swing to design the whole notepad.

This project has two classes - Notepad and FontSelector class
Notepad class contains the main implementation and FontSelector class is used for the functionality of the Font selector UI where user can choose different font styles and font size etc

(Implemented Dark mode in UI, still under progress)

Although this is not the best notepad implementation and there are many improvements which can be done in the code but it totally depends on you that how you can optimize this code.

Any updation in code is heartly welcomed.

So all the very best to everyone and thank you for reading this. Happy Coding â™¥!!!
